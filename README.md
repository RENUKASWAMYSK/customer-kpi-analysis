# Customer Behavior & KPI Analysis

## Objective
To analyze customer purchasing behavior and key business KPIs in order to support better decision-making related to customer retention, product performance, and revenue growth.

## Dataset
Customer orders dataset containing information on customers, orders, sales, categories, and order dates.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- MySQL (SQL queries for KPI analysis)
- Excel (Pivot tables and charts)

## Key Analysis Performed
- Customer-level revenue and order frequency analysis
- Identification of top customers by total sales
- Category-wise revenue contribution
- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Repeat vs one-time customer analysis
- KPI calculations such as Average Order Value (AOV)

## Business Insights
- A small group of customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue.
- High-value customers appear less price-sensitive, indicating the importance of maintaining product quality and trust.
- A limited number of products and categories drive most of the revenue.
- Underperforming products can be identified for corrective actions such as pricing or repositioning.
- Monthly sales trends indicate seasonality, which can support better planning and forecasting.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how customer data and KPIs can be analyzed using Python, SQL, and Excel to generate actionable business insights and improve operational decision-making.
